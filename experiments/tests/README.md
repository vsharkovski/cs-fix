# Test directory

## Setup

1. Download the zip files from [this repository](https://github.com/allenkaykay12/SPA_tests.git)

2. Extract the zip files in this directory.

In the end, you should have three directories: `buggy_test_project`, `buggy-python`, `Python-new`.

These directories were used to produce the results in the paper.
